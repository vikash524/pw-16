    "# Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Flask is a lightweight web application framework written in Python. It provides tools, libraries, and utilities\n",
    "# for building web applications. Flask is known for its simplicity and flexibility, making it a popular choice\n",
    "# for developing web applications and APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "# - Lightweight and Minimalistic: Flask has a simple and minimalistic design, making it easy to learn and use.\n",
    "# - Flexibility: Flask allows developers to choose the components they need and integrate with other libraries.\n",
    "# - Built-in Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in development server, making it easy to develop and test applications.\n",
    "# - Extensibility: Flask supports extensions for adding additional functionality such as authentication, database integration, etc.\n",
    "# - Large Community: Flask has a large and active community of developers, providing support and resources.\n",
